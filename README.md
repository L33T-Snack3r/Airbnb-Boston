# Airbnb-Boston
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook files used in analysis of Boston Airbnb data (publicly available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston)

##Installations
The Anaconda distribution is required to run the code in this repository. All necessary libraries should come pre-installed with Anaconda. 
The version of python used for this investigation is Python 3.10.9. 

##Motivation
This investigation was conducted as part of the first project in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. I was interestested in using Boston Airbnb data from 2017 to understand:

1. Which numerical and categorical features correlate with rating score?
2. Does neighbourhood have a correlation with rating score and price? 
3. Can we find negative and positive reviews based on review comments alone?
4. How accurately can we predict rating score (without features which are clearly directly related)
